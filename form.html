            <h5 class="underline">OFFICIAL RULES FOR FISHING IN IRELAND</h5>
            <p>In the Republic of Ireland, a State Licence is required to fish for both salmon and sea trout. You usually need to buy a local permit in addition to your State Licence before fishing.

            For trout, pike and coarse fishing, a licence is not required (but you may need to purchase a local permit). You can fish in the sea for almost all species without the need for a licence or permit.

            In Northern Ireland, you need a licence for all freshwater fishing but not for sea fishing.

            In the Republic of Ireland State Salmon and Sea Trout Licences are available as a National Licence or a District Licence. A National Licence covers all Fishery Board Districts while a District Licence covers only the Fishery District in which the licence is purchased. A list of fishing tackle shops where licences may be bought is available on this site. Alternatively you can buy a licence online.

            It should be noted that a licence does not confer the right to fish for salmon or sea trout and that permission or permits are required to fish most waters.

            Anglers in the Shannon Region must have a Permit (ticket charge) to fish for trout, pike or coarse fish in the Midland Fisheries Group of controlled waters. This area comprises the following river catchments; RIVER SUCK, RIVER INNY, RIVER BROSNA, LITTLE BROSNA RIVER and CAMLIN RIVER. This permit is not required to fish the main River Shannon or other fisheries whose fishing rights are NOT under the control of the Inland Fisheries Ireland.

            For up-to-date information on all licence and permit regulations in Northern Ireland visit the Northern Ireland Tourist Board website.

            Access to Fisheries
            Anglers must always remember that access does not imply a right of way and should ensure that they have the necessary permission to enter or cross private lands. Respect livestock and crops – where possible, anglers should walk the headlands of fields or along the riverbank or lakeshore.

            Leave No Trace
            Anglers should ensure that gates are closed and that fences are not damaged or broken. Care should be taken with crops and livestock. Litter must not be discarded and no fires are allowed. Vehicles should be parked in designated areas and in such a manner, as they do not cause obstruction.</p>
